## Usage

- Right click on any file/folder in your workspace to copy its path hierarchy ex.`vendor/some/deeply/nested/dir` or `vendor/some/deeply/nested/dir/file.ext`
- Right click on any folder to create the path hierarchy ex.`./src`
    - You'll be presented with a quick pick dialog showing all path segments
    - Uncheck any segments you don't want to include in the final path
    - The folder structure will be created based on your selections
